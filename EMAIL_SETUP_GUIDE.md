# Email Verification & Password Reset Setup Guide

## Overview
This application now includes email verification for new user registrations and password reset functionality. Here's how to set it up:

## Features Implemented

### 1. Email Verification
- ✅ Users must verify their email before accessing the dashboard
- ✅ Custom email templates with XtraPay Business branding
- ✅ Resend verification email functionality
- ✅ Automatic redirect to verification page after registration

### 2. Password Reset
- ✅ "Forgot Password" link on login page
- ✅ Custom password reset email templates
- ✅ Secure token-based password reset
- ✅ 60-minute expiration on reset links

## Email Configuration

### For Development (Local Testing)
Add these settings to your `.env` file:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=log
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@xtrapay.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="XtraPay Business"
```

This will log emails to `storage/logs/laravel.log` instead of sending them.

### For Production
Add these settings to your `.env` file:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=your_smtp_host
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@yourdomain.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="XtraPay Business"
```

### Popular SMTP Providers

#### Gmail
```env
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
```

#### SendGrid
```env
MAIL_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=apikey
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_sendgrid_api_key
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
```

#### Mailgun
```env
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailgun.org
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your_mailgun_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_mailgun_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
```

## How It Works

### Registration Flow
1. User fills out registration form
2. Account is created but email is not verified
3. Verification email is sent automatically
4. User is redirected to verification notice page
5. User clicks verification link in email
6. Email is verified and user can access dashboard

### Password Reset Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot Password" on login page
2. User enters email address
3. Reset link is sent to email
4. User clicks reset link
5. User enters new password
6. Password is updated and user can login

### Email Verification Flow
1. User logs in with unverified email
2. System checks if email is verified
3. If not verified, redirects to verification page
4. User can resend verification email
5. Once verified, user can access all features

## Security Features

- ✅ Email verification required for dashboard access
- ✅ Password reset tokens expire after 60 minutes
- ✅ Rate limiting on verification and reset requests
- ✅ Secure signed URLs for email verification
- ✅ CSRF protection on all forms

## Customization

### Email Templates
- Email verification template: `resources/views/emails/verify-email.blade.php`
- Password reset template: `resources/views/emails/reset-password.blade.php`

### Notification Classes

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

2. Check that the signed URL middleware is working
3. Verify the verification routes are accessible
